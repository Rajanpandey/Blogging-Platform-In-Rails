# Ruby on Rails - Blog with Comments

Building a blog with comments using Ruby on Rails is a foundational exercise I went through to learn more about the framework. 


### Kicking things off with a blog

To easily demonstrate the principles of working with Ruby on Rails I chose to build a basic blog. Each blog post will be able to be created, read, edited, and deleted. There will also be comments associated with each individual blog post. Comments will be able to be created and deleted.

### Gems used in the project

- [Better Errors](https://rubygems.org/gems/better_errors) - Easier on the eyes when it comes to errors.

- [Bulma](https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails) - Most of the time I would roll my own CSS or just use bits of a framework. I'm a big fan of bulma so we will be using it a lot throughout this series.

- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - This gem is useful for live reloading our `scss`, `js`, `css`, and `erb` files, although it's capable of much more! *Guard is required for the Guard LiveReload gem to work*
