# Ruby on Rails - Blog with Comments

Building a blog with comments using Ruby on Rails is a foundational exercise I went through to learn more about the framework. Working together, both Ruby and Rails lend us a hand to generate a fairly simple MVC pattern built on top of a CRUD approach when working with dynamic data. 

### Kicking things off with a blog

To easily demonstrate the principles of working with Ruby on Rails I chose to build a basic blog. Each blog post will be able to be created, read, edited, and deleted. There will also be comments associated with each individual blog post. Comments will be able to be created and deleted.

With Ruby on Rails, the possibilities are pretty endless in terms of what you can build. I'm sure new features and improvements to our blog are easy to spot as I guide you through the process of building it. My goal was to ease newcomers into the conventions, methods, and code patterns that helped me best when I first dove in. I hope you too can benefit.

Ultimately, the point of this tutorial and video is to help anyone new to the framework understand how it operates as well as the necessary conventions required to create a blog using Ruby on Rails. I touch on things such as routing, controllers, views, models, migrations, relations, and more. For this project, we make use of a few `gems` of which help make my life a bit easier as I build out applications. You can find out more about those below.


### Gems used in the project

- [Better Errors](https://rubygems.org/gems/better_errors) - Easier on the eyes when it comes to errors.

- [Bulma](https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails) - Most of the time I would roll my own CSS or just use bits of a framework. I'm a big fan of bulma so we will be using it a lot throughout this series.

- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - This gem is useful for live reloading our `scss`, `js`, `css`, and `erb` files, although it's capable of much more! *Guard is required for the Guard LiveReload gem to work*
